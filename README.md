# Welcome to the first online meeting!

## There is a good markdown cheat sheet here:

[Link to the cheatsheat](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md). Though, it's better to know more about markdown too.

## Intro to Markdown! (And it's uses)

This is a .md (Markdown File) and what we generally use in the github repos
README files are generally used for documenting code or giving a quickstart
guide for using it.

### Italics and bold (make titles with #)

1. You can number things in _ordered lists_. Add *italics* with words using either _this_ or *that*.
2. **Bold** is done similarly and you can use either __this__ or **that** as well.
3. You can also ~~strike~~ things out!

### Unordered lists and hyperlinks

* Unordered lists are also useful as we will see in html, which is similar.
* You don't have to just use markdown for code. We use it for notes all the time!
* Hyperlinks can be made in markdown too. [Link to our website.](https://swctech.club)

### Sub-lists

1. Sub-lists can be useful.
  * They can be used to elaborate on points sometimes.
  * They can be used in combination with unordered lists/ordered lists.
2. Wow, look at that, we're more than half way done!

### To-Do's / Checking things off

- [ ] You can also make to-do lists!
- [X] And even check them off
  - [ ] There's even sub-todo-lists!
  - [X] And markdown formatting is *still* valid even **inside** ~~other~~ elements.

### Quotes

> "I wish someone was listening to me talk right now"

> \- Me, 2021

### Content inside of tables!

 Names  | Is cool?
------- | --------
Preston | yes
Rainier | no (real)

### Code Blocks

Later on, we will need to write short snippets of example code within explanations.

```python
e = True
if e:
  print("Hello, world! How are you doing?")
```

Or alternatively, one lined snippets, without syntax highlighting

`print("Atom is a good text editor!")`
